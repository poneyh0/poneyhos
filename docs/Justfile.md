# Justfile Documentation

The `Justfile` contains various commands and configurations for building and
managing container images and virtual machine images using Podman and other
utilities. It is also used inside Github Actions.

## Required Utilities

Container build:

- [just](https://just.systems/man/en/introduction.html)
- [podman](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org)

These are usually preinstalled on Universal Blue's Bootc Images.

Linting:

- shfmt
- shellcheck

## Environment Variables

These are all sourced from the `image-template.env` file.

- `image_name`: The name of the image (default: "poneyhos").
- `default_tag`: The default tag for the image (default: "latest").
- `bib_image`: The Bootc Image Builder (BIB) image (default: "quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder:latest").

## Building The Image

All these recipes will work (with default values) without supplying any
arguments to them, e.g. `just build`

### `just build`

Builds a container image using Podman.

```bash
just build $target_image $tag
```

Arguments:

- `$target_image`: The tag you want to apply to the image (default: `$image_name`).
- `$tag`: The tag for the image (default: `$default_tag`).

### Rechunking

We can flatten the layers of container images to make sure there isn't a
single huge layer when your image gets published.
This does not make your image faster to download, just provides better resumability.

#### `just ostree-rechunk`

Rechunks the existing Image with [rpm-ostree](https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/build-chunked-oci/)

```bash
just ostree-rechunk $target_image $tag
```

#### `just rechunk`

Rechunks the existing Image with [chunkah](https://github.com/coreos/chunkah),
this is probably gonna be the default here at some point, try it out, it's cool.

```bash
just rechunk $target_image $tag
```

### Switching to the locally built image for testing

The image has to be in the containers-storage owned by root, to be able to
rebase to it, see the `_rootful_load_image` recipe.

`sudo just build` and `sudo just ostree-rechunk` builds directly as root and
allows you to skip the transfer to the root containers-storage.

You can rebase to all the images that are in your containers-storage:

```bash
sudo podman image list --filter=label=containers.bootc=1
```

See [man bootc switch](https://bootc.dev/bootc/man/bootc-switch.8.html) for more info.

```bash
sudo bootc switch --transport containers-storage localhost/myimage:latest
```

and reboot your system!

## Building and Running Virtual Machines and ISOs

The below commands all build QCOW2 images. To produce or use a different type
of image, substitute in the command with that type in the place of `qcow2`.
The available types are `qcow2`, `iso`, and `raw`.

### `just build-qcow2`

Builds a QCOW2 virtual machine image.

```bash
just build-qcow2 $target_image $tag
```

### `just rebuild-qcow2`

Rebuilds a QCOW2 virtual machine image.

```bash
just rebuild-vm $target_image $tag
```

### `just run-vm-qcow2`

Runs a virtual machine from a QCOW2 image.

```bash
just run-vm-qcow2 $target_image $tag
```

### `just spawn-vm`

Runs a virtual machine using systemd-vmspawn.

```bash
just spawn-vm rebuild="0" type="qcow2" ram="6G"
```

## File Management

### `just check`

Checks the syntax of all `.just` files and the `Justfile`.

### `just fix`

Fixes the syntax of all `.just` files and the `Justfile`.

### `just clean`

Cleans the repository by removing build artifacts.

### `just lint`

Runs shell check on all Bash scripts.

### `just format`

Runs shfmt on all Bash scripts.
